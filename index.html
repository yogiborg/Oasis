            Oasis is a village company–a new kind of housing and living company that caters to the needs of today's workforce and environmental conditions. Our homes and villages are designed for people who need everything–quality, affordability, convenience, and sustainability</p>

            <p class="text header">The Mission:</p>
            <ul class="text a">
                <li>&#8195&#8195&#8195No one should have to worry about finding an apartment. With surprising switches between remote and in-person work and non-transitory inflation sending the cost of living soaring, all Americans deserve access to affordable housing throughout the country which suits their individual living needs.</li>
                <li>&#8195&#8195&#8195Sustainable, community focused living and affordable luxury for all Americans regardless of their background, identity, or paycheck.</li>
                <li>&#8195&#8195&#8195We will build micro apartments, mid sized apartments, condos, and luxury townhouses built of the best sustainable materials, around communities designed from the bottom up to encourage the happiness and wellness of all subscribers.</li>
                <li>&#8195&#8195&#8195We will provide the best housing possible for remote workers, including a community work center in every Oasis village. Subscribers will get access to high-speed internet.</li>
                <li>&#8195&#8195&#8195We will encourage companies and start-ups to house their entire workforce in an Oasis village and utilize our community work centers to accelerate their start up and allow their employees cheap living satisfying entrepreneurs and their employees.</li>
                <li>&#8195&#8195&#8195We will build Oasis villages in every American city and every college campus to provide cheap, affordable living to priced out renters and students looking for more community oriented living spaces.</li>
                <li>&#8195&#8195&#8195We will provide a ride-sharing and bus system available through the subscription. We want to provide employment by working for the community.</li>
                <li>&#8195&#8195&#8195We will power and heat the homes through cheap and renewable ways whenever possible, including working with cutting-edge geothermal heat-pump, solar, and wind energy.</li>
                <li>&#8195&#8195&#8195We will provide discounts on food and essential items to Oasis subscribers when purchased through the village market.</li>
                <li>&#8195&#8195&#8195Free cancellation of subscriptions or moving to new Oasis villages. On-site workers will take care of everything a resistants need, regardless if they’re living in a microapartment or a full-sized townhouse.</li>
                <li>&#8195&#8195&#8195We will conserve water sustainably and integrate the villages with nature whenever possible. We will provide greenspace, dog parks, and athletic facilities to all subscribers.</li>
                <li>&#8195&#8195&#8195We will provide cutting edge education services to all subscribers and their children.</li>
                <li>&#8195&#8195&#8195We will provide state of the art security to all subscribers.</li>
                <li>&#8195&#8195&#8195We will have weekend activities such as night clubs and gaming provided to subscribers, though the drinks are not free.</li>
                <li>&#8195&#8195&#8195We will provide furniture and screens–no need to lug around your own.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="text header">The Plan:</p>
            <p>The Oasis Subscription model will be the perfect way to live for anyone who wants to be able to work and play in any location they choose.<br><br>The Oasis Subscription Model will provide access to unoccupied Oasis Housing Units throughout the nation that can be used as either permanent or temporary living quarters, depending on your needs. All you have to do is select what type of home you want, how many people (or pets/ robots) will be staying with you, and we'll take care of the rest. If there are no available homes at your desired location, we'll simply make more. People will be charged for their current residence based on a weekly subscription model.<br><br>This model competes with traditional housing companies, hotels, and other app-based models. Subscribers can live in luxury, traveling from location to location with nothing more than essentials.<br><br>We will use artificial intelligence in every area of our company to help us grow faster, improve our services, and reduce costs for everyone. Our sustainable building practices—including geothermal heat-pumps, wind power, and solar energy—will enable us to shorten construction timeframes, lower electricity bills, and decrease maintenance costs significantly.<br><br>A microapartment would be the cheapest option available, costing no more than $500 a month. From there, the models can get more expensive depending on the needs of the customer, ranging from slightly larger apartments for larger families, to luxury townhouses decorated by community artists with costs which depend on demand and location. No matter what accommodations you’re living in though, sustainability, community, and well-being always comes first. The full suite of discounts will be available to all subscribers including access to athletic facilities and public transportation.<br><br>Eventually, we seek to convert all Americans to our living model, driving record profits for our company by reducing costs for all Americans in an increasingly remote and automated world.</p>

            <p class="text">Brendan and Yogini Werth left the comforts of their parents' home in New Jersey and headed to Southern California to start a new life from scratch.<br><br>They had no money, no job, and no place to live.<br><br>But they did have a crazy idea: to create a new kind of housing and living company that caters to the needs of today's workforce.<br><br>With that, Oasis was born. Oasis is a company that provides microapartments, apartments, condos, townhouses, co-working and collaborative workspace, and value-added living services.</p>
